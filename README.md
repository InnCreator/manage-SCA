Your task for the week is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.  

IT MUST BE SIMILAR TO THE IMAGE https://res.cloudinary.com/edify-solutions/image/upload/v1589987679/desktop-design_xvzq5f.jpgFor where we have icons and images, you can get any image or icons yourselves online, you can as well use different colors.

HOW TO SUBMIT: Push the code to Github and host it (here you can use gitbub.io or Netlify). The hosted link should be submitted right in front of your group on the excel sheet. DEADLINE:  MONDAY( MAY 25TH) 

N/B: We know this task might be quite simple for some to do, however we believe it is your responsibility to carry your partner along while doing it. That way everyone can all learn. Don't Forget to ask for help online if you are stuck.
